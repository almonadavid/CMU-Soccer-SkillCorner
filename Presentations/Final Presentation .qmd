## Turning Defense to Attack

# Main Question
Can the effectiveness of a press in soccer be predicted using factors such as spatial context, pressing dynamics, game context and situational factors?

# Key Terms
**Pressing:** a defensive tactic where players apply coordinated pressure on the opponent with the ball to force mistakes, win back possession, and quickly transition to attack

**Forced Turnover:** when a player loses possession due to opponent pressure, resulting in the opposing team gaining control. This includes misplaced passes, interceptions, successful tackles, or losing control under pressure - all direct results of effective defensive pressure


## Data

-   **Dataset:** 520 matches in the MLS 2023 season

-   **Three data types:**
    -   **Match information:** game details (teams, pitch, referee)
    -   **Event data:** player actions (passes, shots, tackles) with timestamps and coordinates
    -   **Tracking data:** real-time positions of all players and ball at 10 Hz

## The Pressure Zone

-   Be within **6 meters** of the ball carrier

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Problem:** 6-meter radius doesn't account for direction

- Equal threat from all angles?
- Oversimplifies pressing

## The Pressure Zone: Revised



## Methods: Detecting Pressure Sequences

::: fragment
-   Pressing actions were grouped into sequences if at least one defender continued pressing, allowing gaps of up to 1.5 seconds.
:::

::: fragment
-   A new sequence was defined after any pause longer than 1.5 seconds.
:::

::: fragment
-   For each sequence, the following features were recorded:
    -   duration, number of defenders involved and average defender velocity at the start
:::

## Feature Engineering

::: fragment
-   **Spatial Context:** Ball carrier position, distance to boundaries, field third
:::

::: fragment
-   **Pressing Dynamics:** Number of defenders, approach velocity, passing options
:::

::: fragment
-   **Game Context:** Score, game state (winning/losing/drawing), time remaining
:::

::: fragment
-   **Situational Factors:** How ball carrier gained possession (pass reception, interception, etc.), incoming pass characteristics (distance, height, range)
:::

## Modeling

::: fragment
-   **Model:**
    -   Logistic Regression\
    -   XGBoost\
    -   All models evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation
:::

## Model Performance

```{r model-sum}
#| include: TRUE
#| echo: FALSE
#| eval: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig.width: 24
#| fig.height: 16
#| fig.cap: "plot"

library(magick)
model_sum <- image_read("../Visualizations/model_summary.png") |> 
  image_ggplot(interpolate = TRUE)

model_sum
```

## Results

```{r div-plot}
#| include: TRUE
#| echo: FALSE
#| eval: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig.width: 24
#| fig.height: 16
#| fig.cap: "plot"


div_plot <- image_read("../Visualizations/diverging_plot.png") |> 
  image_ggplot(interpolate = TRUE)
div_plot
```

## 

```{r vol-eff}
#| include: TRUE
#| echo: FALSE
#| eval: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig.width: 24
#| fig.height: 16
#| fig.cap: "plot"


vol_eff <- image_read("../Visualizations/volume_vs_effectiveness_plot.png") |> 
  image_ggplot(interpolate = TRUE)
vol_eff
```

## Discussion

::: fragment
-   **Limitations:**
    -   Inaccuracy in SkillCorner data
    -   Individual player skill and tactical tendencies not considered in the model
    -   Our model does not account for pitch control
:::

::: fragment
-   **Future Works:**
    -   Incorporate pressing intensity calculations
    -   Incorporate pitch control
